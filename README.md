# 12-Employee-Tracker

## What I did in this project

In this project I made an employee tracker application by utilizing SQL database tools

## Why is this project important

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.

## What I learned from this project

I learned that I almost have everything together and that I am beginning to have a decent understanding of node, express and SQL and all of the crazy things that can be built using this technology
